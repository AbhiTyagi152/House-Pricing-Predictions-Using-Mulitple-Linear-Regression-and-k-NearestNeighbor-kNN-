# House-Pricing-Predictions-Using-Mulitple-Linear-Regression-and-k-NearestNeighbor-kNN-

## Introduction
The aim of this project was to use regression to create realistic models that could predict housing prices and to assess the models' efficiency and performance. The objective was to determine the value of real estate accurately and identify the relevant factors that directly impact property prices. Two models were employed in the study, namely, multiple linear regression and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN).

The outcomes revealed that the multiple linear regression model outperformed the kNN model, with the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) at 151,751.64, 58,443,560,506.06, and 241,751.03, respectively. The model was deemed to be a good one if the MAE and RMSE were low, and hence, it was found to be the most suitable model for predicting housing prices.

Additionally, further investigation into the kNN model indicated that the k=10 regression model had the lowest RMSE at 261,231.41, proving that the model performed better when ten nearest neighbors were used.

In conclusion, this project successfully utilized multiple linear regression and kNN models to forecast housing prices and evaluated their efficacy. The multiple linear regression model was established as the most suitable model for predicting housing prices based on its low MAE, MSE, and RMSE. This study provides valuable insights into the factors that influence housing prices and emphasizes the significance of selecting the appropriate model for making accurate predictions in real estate.
